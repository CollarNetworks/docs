# Rolling a Loan

### What is Rolling a Loan?

Rolling a loan means repaying an existing loan by taking out a new one, typically with the same or updated terms, in order to extend the duration of the borrowing.

### How to Roll a Loan

To roll a loan, look for a roll proposal on your loan details page.

### Why Roll a Loan?

Rolling a loan can be a strategic financial decision for several reasons. Here's why you might need or want to roll a loan:

=== Extended Loan Term

- **Need More Time**: If you need more time to repay your loan, rolling it can extend the loan term, providing you with additional time to manage your finances without defaulting.
- **Cash Flow Management**: Extending the loan term can help manage cash flow by reducing the immediate financial burden of large repayments.

=== Improved Loan Terms

- **Better Interest Rates**: If market conditions have changed since you took out the original loan, rolling it might allow you to secure a lower interest rate, reducing the overall cost of the loan.
- **Flexible Repayment Options**: Rolling a loan can offer more flexible repayment options that better align with your current financial situation.

=== Consolidation of Debt

- **Simplified Payments**: If you have multiple loans, rolling them into a single loan can simplify your payments, making it easier to manage your debt.
- **Reduced Interest Costs**: Consolidating loans can sometimes reduce the total interest paid over time, especially if the new loan has a lower interest rate.

=== Avoiding Default

- **Preventing Penalties**: If you're at risk of defaulting on your loan, rolling it can prevent penalties and negative impacts on your credit score by restructuring the debt.

=== Taking Advantage of Market Opportunities

- **Investment Opportunities**: If rolling a loan frees up capital, you might be able to take advantage of investment opportunities that could yield higher returns than the cost of the loan.

Rolling a loan should be considered carefully, weighing the benefits against any potential costs or risks. It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to ensure that rolling a loan aligns with your overall financial strategy.
