#### Settlement at Maturity

- Currently, maturities of expired positions are facilitated by a permitted "keeper" which is hosted in the "Offchain Intent Platform" (i.e. a server running a cron job on a periodic basis)
- This is purely done to improve the user experience and is a target for decentralization / removal in future versions with incentives
