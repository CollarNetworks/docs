#### We aspire to create a new global financial network powered by the low-cost trust that blockchains provide.

The core innovation of blockchains is that they reduce the cost of trust by an order of magnitude, and far below the taxes and fees we all currently pay to institutions around the globe. Over time, we hope to build a better, faster, cheaper, more fair financial system.

We have a number of future products in mind that are currently only available to high net worth individuals. We look forward to bringing them to the world.
