# Introducing Votre

### A Smarter Way to Borrow Against Crypto

Votre is a liquidation-free, non-custodial lending protocol that allows users to borrow against their crypto assets with high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, low interest, and potential tax advantages. Unlike traditional lending platforms, Votre removes directional risk upfront, ensuring borrowers never face forced liquidation.

By leveraging providers instead of liquidators, Votre guarantees performance up to a return cap, allowing borrowers to access liquidity while maintaining exposure to their assets.

### Why Choose Votre?

- [x] **Liquidation-Free** – No risk of forced liquidation, as assets are swapped upfront.

- [x] **Non-Custodial** – Users retain full control; positions can mature automatically.
- [x] **Liquidity-Independent** – No reliance on unsustainable yield farming.

- [x] **High LTV** – LTVs as high as 95%, depending on provider terms.

- [x] **Asset-Agnostic** – Works with any ERC-20 asset pair with DEX liquidity.

Votre is designed for borrowers who want efficient, flexible, and secure access to liquidity without the drawbacks of traditional lending. Whether you’re an investor looking to unlock capital without selling assets or a fund manager optimizing capital efficiency, Votre provides a smarter way to borrow against crypto.
