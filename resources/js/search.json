We've built Collar in order to solve the liquidation problem and DeFi’s borrowing trilemma (stability of borrowed assets, liquidation of collateral, high LTV).","We do this by helping connect borrowers with marketmakers via an on-chain request-for-quote (RFQ) process, resulting in a “COLlaborative Lending ARrangement” (Collar).","This arrangement allows borrowers to forego upside exposure above a ceiling temporarily in order to protect their downside below some floor price, below which the borrower can always walk away with their stablecoin loan.","Note: it is important to emphasize that upside is not entirely foregone. Users can request for a marketmaker to roll a trade at any time. The Collar team is also developing \"auto-roll\" functionality in order to make this process easier.","To execute a trade, each party supplies collateral to the Collar Engine, the protocol swaps the risky asset for stablecoins via a decentralized exchange, pays out the loan, and creates a Collar Vault with both parties’ remaining collateral, which is used to handle rolls, settlement, lifecycle, and maturity.","At maturity, collateral is divided between the marketmaker and borrower based on the final price of the asset, which is obtained via oracle, and the terms of the trade agreed upon upfront. Oracle independence is possible with Collar but the team has decided to delay this feature for the initial launch.","In the subsequent paragraphs, we give a more thorough explanation of how this process works, explaining the design choices we’ve made along the way, and shedding light on the financial backdrop that made this necessary and the crypto backdrop that made this possible.","This process is illustrated more in depth in the next section."]}],[{"i":"collar-v0-the-rfq-model","l":"Collar v0: The RFQ Model","p":["ACKD - means the client has been acknowledged by the marketmaker","As a client, your goal is to get as large of a loan as you need, for as long as you need, while retaining as much upside as you can, all while avoiding any form of liquidation.","Borrower Certainty","Collar runs on an RFQ (request-for-quote) model, where users request pricing from a network of marketmakers who compete for the trade.","Competition","DONE - means the client has said \"DONE\" and consented to a trade","Error reduction vs. TradFi","Here's how it works.","MEV Prevention","NEW - means the client has nothing currently priced","OFF - means the marketmaker has pulled the price due to market movement","Once a trade is priced, we will know the following fields:","Openness","PXD - means the client can now accept or reject the price","REJ - means the client or marketmaker has rejected the pricing and a new pricing can be requested","REQD - means the client has requested a price from a marketmaker","Some benefits of the RFQ model include...","The marketmaker is trying to give you the best terms they can while still making money.

Collar connects clients and marketmakers.","p":["When clients submit a \"request for quote\" (RFQ), that RFQ is broadcasted to all marketmakers in the Collar Network. In our beta stage, this role is whitelisted, but over time, it will be decentralized.","Marketmakers are expected, at this time, to price and quote trades as quickly as is feasible. Similar to TradFi, consent to a trade is gradual.","First, marketmakers show an indicative price to the client. If the client likes the price and has not received a better price from another marketmaker, they can request execution by placing their underlying asset into escrow via Collar's smart contracts.","Once the client has requested execution, the marketmaker has the chance to accept or decline. If the marketmakers decline the trade, the client's asset will be returned to them. Clients can also withdraw their execution requests if they feel so inclined so long as marketmakers have not already accepted the trade.","By agreeing to hedge a Collar, marketmakers are expected to deposit sufficient USDC to ensure that the client will get paid out in their best case scenario (an appreciation in the underlier to the point of the cap).","Hedging this trade is inherently bearish because it pays off more when the asset falls in value, so you would want to buy some of the underlying asset upfront separately in order to counteract that force (i.e. hedging your delta). There is also volatility exposure for a fixed period of time, at a specific strike, which is a bit harder to hedge.","Once all parties accept, Collar will go out to the market and swap the asset for USDC via a decentralized exchange such as Uniswap, pay out the loan to the user, then hold the remaining client collateral in escrow until maturity alongside the marketmaker's collateral.","Over the life of the trade, if the price of the underlying asset increases, the client will likely want to \"roll\" the trade higher. To do this, they can request a roll quote via a similar RFQ process as the initial trade, and marketmakers can execute these rolls using the Collar UI.","Also, specific terms of the trade may be altered without marketmaker consent such as the settlement preferences (physical vs. cash vs. net-share) as these have no economic impact for marketmakers, but may have tax consequences for the user.","At maturity, any party (marketmakers, clients, keepers, etc.) can mature a Collar vault by calling the \"mature\" function. Once this is called, funds are returned to the marketmaker and user in line with the new price of the asset in line with whatever terms were agreed with upfront.","Collar, unlike many other DeFi protocols, does not rely on unsustainable incentives to achieve user or marketmaker adoption.","From the client's perspective, they are risking, in this case, $100k ((100 - floor )*notional) to make $80k ((cap - 100)*notional), all while getting $900k in USDC liquidity against their ETH and preserving $1mm notl of exposure to their asset.
