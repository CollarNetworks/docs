This is typically done to access liquidity without triggering capital gains or risking liquidation.","If the price of the asset increases, the individual can renegotiate the range higher, unlocking a bigger loan. They can even elect to use other shares they hold to “net share settle” in order to extend and maintain the position.","Collar is essentially a codified, non-custodial wrapper for such an arrangement that leverages passive liquidity to hedge the trade upfront.","Previously, these trades were only accessible to high net worth individuals with $10mm+ in assets. They were also highly manual and bespoke, requiring significant legal documentation to ensure complexities were met by each party. Even so, it could take months to execute one of these trades, and it was very costly to do so in terms of legal, operational, compliance, and other costs.","Trustless, programmable money removes these limitations."]}],[{"l":"Litepaper"},{"i":"collars-smart-contracts-streamline-battle-tested-financial-technology","l":"Collar's smart contracts streamline battle-tested financial technology.","p":["Welcome to Collar, the liquidation-free borrowing solution. We've built Collar in order to solve the liquidation problem and DeFi’s borrowing trilemma (stability of borrowed assets, liquidation of collateral, high LTV).","We do this by helping connect borrowers with marketmakers and suppliers via an on-chain request-for-quote (RFQ) process, resulting in a “COLlaborative Lending ARrangement” (Collar).","This arrangement allows borrowers to forego upside exposure above a ceiling temporarily in order to protect their downside below some floor price, below which the borrower can always walk away with their stablecoin loan.","Note: it is important to emphasize that upside is not entirely foregone. Users can request for a marketmaker to extend a contract at any time. The Collar team is also developing \"auto-roll\" functionality in order to make this process easier.","To execute a trade, the borrower supplies collateral that will be seized if the borrower fails to repay. A supplier The marketmaker then locks collateral swaps the risky asset for stablecoins via a decentralized exchange, pays out the loan, and creates a Collar Vault with both parties’ remaining collateral, which is used to handle rolls, settlement, lifecycle, and maturity.","At maturity, collateral is divided between the marketmaker and borrower based on the final price of the asset, which is obtained via oracle, and the terms of the trade agreed upon upfront. Oracle independence is possible with Collar but the team has decided to delay this feature for the initial launch.","In the subsequent paragraphs, we give a more thorough explanation of how this process works, explaining the design choices we’ve made along the way, and shedding light on the financial backdrop that made this necessary and the crypto backdrop that made this possible.","This process is illustrated more in depth in the next section."]}],[{"i":"collar-v0-the-rfq-model","l":"Collar v0: The RFQ Model","p":["-- v0 has been retired, please see v1! --","ACKD - means the client has been acknowledged by the marketmaker","As a client, your goal is to get as large of a loan as you need, for as long as you need, while retaining as much upside as you can, all while avoiding any form of liquidation.","Borrower Certainty","Collar's first version ran on an RFQ (request-for-quote) model, where users requested pricing from a network of marketmakers who compete for the trade.","Competition","DONE - means the client has said \"DONE\" and consented to a trade","Error reduction vs. TradFi","Here's how it works.","MEV Prevention","NEW - means the client has nothing currently priced","OFF - means the marketmaker has pulled the price due to market movement","Once a trade is priced, we will know the following fields:","Openness","PXD - means the client can now accept or reject the price","REJ - means the client or marketmaker has rejected the pricing and a new pricing can be requested","REQD - means the client has requested a price from a marketmaker","Some benefits of the RFQ model include...","The marketmaker is trying to give you the best terms they can while still making money.

Soon, marketmakers will be able to provide liquidity to Collar's pools in order to easily facilitate Collars.","Here's how it works.","For each unique combination of asset, collateral, duration, and LTV, there exists a pool with various ticks. These ticks, similar to uniswap v3, are 1 basis point (.01%) apart by default, but may be scaled to .1% or 1% depending on the \"tickScaleFactor\" of the pool.","Marketmakers provide liquidity at a given tick in order to reflect their willingness to trade at that price. (i.e. tick 12000 with a tickScaleFactor of 1 reflects a 120% ceiling on collateral performance that a user is accepting)","These pools bring marketmaker's willingness to trade onchain and help constrain users to a few standardized trades, making it easier for both sides to transact. This model also creates a 1-click experience for users.","For example, if a marketmaker is willing to show a ceiling of 120% on an ETH/USDC/90% LTV/3 month loan for up to 1 ETH at a price of 3000, they would provide 600 USDC of liquidity to the 12000 tick to reflect that. Users would see this and execute.","Finally, we're developing an open-source marketmaker SDK in order to make Collar easy to connect with and provide liquidity to."]},{"l":"FUTURE FEATURES","p":["If a user has a large trade they'd like to execute and they're not seeing sufficient liquidity at a price they like, we're exploring building out a \"request liquidity\" function to facilitate this","Another feature under development is \"just-in-time\" liquidity, where marketmakers commit capital to a single pool, which is only used for settlement of new vaults, and allows marketmakers to show prices across numerous pools.","For example, if there are four different ETH/USDC/90% LTV pools at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively, marketmakers shouldn't have to commit liquidity to each pool in order to show prices. If a user comes in and takes liquidity (i.e. executes on a trade) on a 6 month Collar, then the capacity of the other pools would decrease as that USDC was drawn from the MM's master collateral account."]}],[{"l":"Marketmaking"},{"i":"marketmakers-put-up-collateral-in-order-to-hedge-trades-and-make-money-collar-connects-clients-and-marketmakers","l":"Marketmakers put up collateral in order to hedge trades and make money. Collar connects clients and marketmakers.","p":["Marketmakers are expected, at this time, to quote potential trades by providing liquidity.","By agreeing to hedge a Collar, marketmakers are expected to deposit sufficient USDC to ensure that the client will get fully paid out in the best case scenario (appreciation of the underlier to the ceiling).","Hedging this trade is inherently bearish because marketmakers make the most when the asset falls in value. As such, they naturally would want to go long the underlying asset in response to a completed trade (i.e. hedging your delta). There is also volatility exposure for a fixed period of time, at a specific strike, which is a bit harder to hedge.","Upon client execution, Collar immediately swaps the asset for USDC via a decentralized exchange such as Uniswap, pays out the loan to the user, then holds the remaining client collateral in escrow until maturity alongside the marketmaker's collateral.","Over the life of the trade, if the price of the underlying asset increases, the client will likely want to \"roll\" the trade higher. To do this, they can accept an extension offer from a marketmaker.","At maturity, any party (marketmakers, clients, keepers, etc.) can mature a Collar vault by calling the \"mature\" function. Once this is called, funds are paid out to the marketmaker and user in line with the final price of the asset (as determined by Uniswap v3's TWAP) in line with whatever terms were agreed with upfront via the peer-to-pool execution mechanism","Collar, unlike many other DeFi protocols, does not rely on unsustainable incentives to achieve user or marketmaker adoption and instead relies on marketmakers acting in their self-interest."]}],[{"l":"An Example Trade"},{"i":"weve-outlined-an-entire-trade-to-make-it-abundantly-clear-where-the-money-goes-upon-execution","l":"We've outlined an entire trade to make it abundantly clear where the money goes upon execution.","p":["$1,000 ETH price","100 ETH to hedge","3 months","90% LTV (loan-to-value ratio)","ABC Cap arrives to the collarprotocol.xyz website, selects the terms they'd like, sees there is enough there to borrow against 10 ETH with a max return of 110%, puts up 10 ETH and clicks \"borrow\".","ABC Cap's ETH is stored in Collar's collateral ringfence.","Client wants their loan in USDC","Client wants to borrow against ETH","Collar Protocol Fee of 1%","JSR supplies 1000 USDC of liquidity at a maximum return of 110% to the 3 month, 90% LTV, ETH-USDC pool, reflecting a willingness to be the counterparty for an ETH forward contract.","JSR understands hedging Collars is a bearish trade, so once the trade is executed they go to their favorite source of liquidity and get long ETH to isolate the volatility risk from the directional risk produced by the trade.
