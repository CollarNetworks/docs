[[{"l":"Introduction"},{"i":"welcome-to-collar","l":"Welcome to Collar!","p":["Collar is the best way to borrow against crypto.","Collar is completely non-custodial and does not rely on liquidations to remain solvent. Collar offers the highest LTVs in DeFi without introducing credit or counterparty risk. Collar is powered by solvers instead of liquidators as well as other DeFi primitives like Uniswap v3.","Collar is short for “COLlaborative Lending ARrangement” (Collar). It also happens to match the name of an options strategy with a similar payout profile.","Collars are agreed upon offchain and settled onchain. For those of you Collar OG's, the new architecture is intent-based, relying on offchain, whitelisted solvers to ensure users receive prompt, competitive pricing on proposed Collars. This is called the Offchain Intent Platform throughout these docs.","This documentation explains how Collar works and answers questions prospective borrowers may have. Borrowers can access Collar Protocol via the smart contracts directly or via the Collar Frontend, hosted at https://app.collarprotocol.xyz, launching later this year.","For those who prefer a long-form historical and mathematical walkthrough, our whitepaper will be released in the coming months.","Collar is not available in all jurisdictions or to all prospective borrowers. Usage of Collar may be limited by local regulation. Collar strives to comply with any and all applicable financial regulation; see disclosures for more.","Below, we’ve put together a simple diagram, video, and cashflow tracking spreadsheet which explains in detail how Collar works.","Cashflow Tracking Sheet","Video (under construction)","Flow of Funds Diagram"]}],[{"l":"How It Works","p":["Collar hedges collateral upfront instead of waiting for the price to drop. This allows borrowers to be shielded from any liquidation risk for months at a time.","Collar's Offchain Intent Platform helps borrowers and solvers communicate with one another in order to arrive at acceptable terms. Once this is achieved, solvers create an onchain offer and the borrower accepts, with each party posting collateral only when necessary.","We call this \"just-in-time liquidity provision\".","Below, we’ve put together a simple diagram, video, and cashflow tracking spreadsheet which explains in detail how Collar works.","Cashflow Tracking Sheet","Video (under construction)","Flow of Funds Diagram"]},{"i":"coordination-phase---offchain","l":"Coordination Phase - Offchain","p":["First, borrowers request quotes for a cap (maximum return) from whitelisted solvers via the Offchain Intent Platform. Once solvers show pricing, borrowers accept the best quote or reject the quotes and try another trade. Borrowers can also accept existing Offers \"off the shelf\" from solvers, creating a more one-click experience.","The Offchain Intent Platform, similar to the sequencers of many top rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism, and more, will be progressively decentralized over time via Onchain Auctions and other mechanisms, the same way other DeFi protocols advanced in complexity, decentralization, and performance over time."]},{"i":"settlement-phase---onchain","l":"Settlement Phase - Onchain","p":["If the user accepts, a marketmaker receives a notification and promptly creates an offer, posting the USDC or cash asset required to guarantee the user's upside exposure.","Finally, the user accepts the Offer and provides their collateral. Once this transaction confirms onchain, the marketmaker now benefits from a decline in price. Solvers prefer to remain delta-neutral, so they would likely hedge this out using perps, onchain, or other offchain tools.","Note: In order to collar assets, borrowers must be willing to temporarily forego near-term upside exposure beyond a return cap specified by the liquidity provider, risking a small portion of the borrowed capital for the duration of the loan. For example, a user with 1 wstETH worth $1000 can borrow $900 for 3 months liquidation-free, but returns will be capped at $100 or a final wstETH price of $1100.","Upon acceptance by both parties, the protocol takes the user's collateral (stETH) and swaps it for the liability token (USDC) via Uniswap v3, removing price risk. The proceeds of the swap are then multiplied by the LTV percentage and sent to the user, with the remainder staying as collateral that can be won by the marketmaker. This incentivizes solvers to facilitate collars.","Collar allows for loan renegotiations or \"rolls\", where borrowers can \"re-strike\" higher. This is akin to a climber putting a new spike in the ice as they make progress. If they fall, they get caught by the higher spike.","Over the life of the trade, borrowers are offered terms to extend or \"roll\" their loan, extending the maturity and updating the floor and cap in line with the market. This coordination is facilitated via the Offchain Intent Platform.","If a roll offer is accepted, the loan is extended, and the floor and cap are updated. Depending on the performance of the asset, the user either posts or receives collateral in order to extend.","The Collar Team is also developing \"auto-roll\" functionality in order to make it extremely easy for users to roll as assets are increasing in value.","Since Collar positions are tracked as NFTs that are tradeable by the user and the marketmaker, the marketmaker can purchase the borrower's half of the position and retire the NFTs early in order to close out and reclaim the locked collateral inside. This allows for \"novations\" which remove an inactive marketmaker as well as \"unwinds\" which allow a user to exit a trade early for some price.","Once the blockchain's native timestamp exceeds the vault's maturity timestamp, the Position is able to be matured. Borrowers can wait to repay their loan, but they are fully exposed to any changes in price of the asset (i.e. if the asset appreciates after maturity and the borrower has not repaid their loan, they miss out on gains). This grace period is limited to 5 days, changeable at the configuration level of the protocol.","Loan repayment is handled by the keeper, which is maintained by the Offchain Intent Platform prior to full decentralization. Users are encouraged to authorize a sufficient amount of the liability asset upfront (i.e. USDC) so the keeper can initiate repayment on their behalf. If this approval is not in place, a default would occur even if the user has sufficient USDC in their wallet to repay. Users can specify this \"autopay\" functionality.","Upon being matured, Position collateral is divided between the marketmaker and borrower based on the final price of the asset, which is obtained via a Uniswap TWAP oracle, and the terms of the trade agreed upon upfront. Any liability token awarded to the borrower is combined with the borrower's repaid tokens and sent to Uniswap v3 to repurchase the user's original collateral, which is then returned to them, closing out the trade.","Note: It is worth noting that the team is developing a \"supplier mode\" that will likely experience far better tax treatment and allow the user to not have to sell their collateral."]}],[{"l":"Example Trade","p":["1 wstETH (~$2k)","2,000 USDC/wstETH price","3 month loan duration","90% LTV (loan-to-value ratio)","ABC Cap agrees to move forward, notifying JSR via the Collar Frontend and Offchain Intent Platform, that they have been selected as the winner.","ABC Cap selects the terms they'd like (see above) and clicks request quote. Within seconds, they get back three potential return caps, or \"quotes\": 108%, 109%, and JSR's price 110%. These quotes came from solvers who quickly communicated their preferences via the Offchain Intent Platform.","ABC Cap then accepts the Offer, completing the trade, depositing wstETH to the protocol.","Below, we walk through a sample Collar.","Client wants their loan in USDC","Client wants to borrow against wstETH","Collar Protocol Fee of 1%","JSR prepares an onchain Offer reflecting the terms ABC Cap initially requested, containing 200 USDC, reflecting the collateral requirements of the Collar Protocol of 110% - 100% = 10% * 1 wstETH * 2000 USDC per wstETH = 200 USDC, the best case returns for the user. This reflects JSR's willingness to facilitate the trade.","JSR understands hedging Collars is a bearish trade, so once the trade is executed they go to their favorite source of liquidity and get long wstETH to isolate the volatility risk from the directional risk produced by the trade. This is called \"scalping gamma\" and it's how solvers can make money by isolating and trading volatility itself.","Let's name our most competitive and active marketmaker \"Jane Sigma Research\" or JSR. JSR is hooked up via API to the Offchain Intent Platform and streams prices constantly, providing a phenomenally fast user experience.","Let's say we have a client named \"ABC Capital\" who runs a liquid token fund with various investors. Their strategy is to buy and sell tokens in order to make money. At times, they are fully allocated to wstETH, but want to buy a new token. The problem is, ABC would have to sell wstETH in order to do so, limiting their exposure to wstETH. They could use AAVE to borrow against their wstETH, but then they'd be at risk of forced liquidation. Instead, ABC leverages Collar to borrow against existing tokens and deploy more capital (temporarily) without giving up exposure to their current position.","Of the 1999 USDC of proceeds from this swapped wstETH, 1799.1 is sent to the borrower as the Loan Balance, and 199.9 is deposited into a vault in case the collateral declines in value, incentivizing solvers in a downside scenario. This vault cannot be accessed by anyone until the maturity timestamp is greater than that of block.timestamp (a measurement native to the blockchain).","One of their portfolio managers heard about Collar at a conference and decides to head on over to collarprotocol.xyz, click \"Enter App\" and connect their wallet. From then on, these are the steps they would take, and the corresponding action on the backend that occurs.","Solve for maximum return","The protocol then swaps the supplied wstETH in a decentralized exchange, such as Uniswap v3, for USDC (note: this incurs some slippage). The price at which this swap executes determines the exact maximum and minimum of the vault (i.e. swapping 1 wstETH -> 1999 USDC (0.05% slippage) results in a ceiling of 2198.9 USDC and a floor of 1799.1 USDC)."]},{"i":"wsteth-up-7-scenario","l":"wstETH Up 7% Scenario","p":["A month goes by and wstETH is up 7% vs. USDC, so ABC Cap decides they want to lock in gains, extending their loan. Since JSR is streaming prices to the Offchain Intent Platform, ABC Cap can get estimate roll terms at any time.","6a. ABC Cap then requests execution at terms they saw on the Collar Frontend, prompting JSR to automatically show an offer to extend and restrike the contract at the same percentage strikes of 90% and 110%, posting additional collateral as the asset has appreciated, diminishing JSR's portion of the collateral."]},{"i":"wsteth-down-30-scenario","l":"wstETH Down 30% Scenario","p":["A month goes by and wstETH is down 30% vs. USDC, but ABC Cap believes in the asset and want to extend their Collar. Similarly, JSR has been streaming possible roll prices, and ABC Cap sees this in the Collar Frontend.","6a. ABC Cap sees JSR is demanding 0.29 wstETH to do so (400 USDC of losses, divided by an wstETH price of 1400, rounded up to reflect JSR's cost of hedging) and decides the extension is worth it. ABC Cap uses the Collar Frontend to request execution, JSR confirms by raising an Offer onchain, and ABC Cap accepts, posting the requisite collateral. If ABC Cap couldn't afford this, they could wait until maturity and hope the asset recovers, or they could sell back their portion of the position to the marketmaker for some residual value, abandoning their loan."]},{"l":"At Maturity","p":["As the trade nears maturity, wstETH drops to a price of 1000 USDC. The marketmaker ended up being right and the price of the asset dropped, so they are given the entirety of the USDC from the position.","Currently, any party can mature a vault so long as block.timestamp exceeds the maturity date timestamp. Collar's Offchain Intent Platform also helps facilitate this.","At maturity, the vault observes the Uniswap TWAP oracle provided natively by Uniswap to decide how much collateral to pay out to a given user, in line with the payout diagram displayed on the app's homepage. This oracle is extremely expensive to manipulate over long periods of time (minutes of constant buying onchain)."]}],[{"l":"Benefits"},{"i":"collar-is","l":"Collar is...","p":["Liquidation-Free- Since the protocol swaps the asset upfront, directional risk is removed. But what if the price goes up? This is mitigated by the return cap + the solvers guaranteeing performance on the upside to the ceiling in exchange for the chance to make money if the asset price declines.","Tax-Advantaged- Borrowing can be a better way to sell in most tax regimes, allowing borrowers to withdraw wealth while deferring tax obligations. Note: in some jurisdictions, this will require a feature under development called supplier mode, which is under development.","Non-Custodial- Both parties could abandon Collar and would still receive their payoff at maturity, since anyone can mature a position onchain.","Liquidity-Independent- Collar does not require unsustainable yield farming in order to function.","Interest-Free- Any interest is priced into the terms provided by the marketmaker. Slippage is the main cost paid by borrowers.","High LTV- LTVs are only economically limited by how high a marketmaker is willing to offer. LTVs approaching 100%, even on volatile assets, are possible but may carry tax ramifications. For now, LTVs must be added via the ConfigHub (multi-sig gated) for security purposes.","Collateral Efficient- Collar has been designed from the ground up to require the minimal amount of collateral necessary to function without introducing credit risk into the system.","Asset Agnostic- The logic behind Collar is scalable to any ERC20 asset pair a marketmaker is willing to quote, so long as it has liquidity in any DEX. For now, asset pairs must be added via the ConfigHub (multi-sig gated) for security purposes.","Minimized Hack Surface Area- Hackable value is only a fraction of the total value traded for a given Collar. The lower the LTV and higher the callstrike, the more collateral is at risk from a hack, as more collateral is required for these types of trades.","Minimized MEV Surface Area- We plan to ensure users are not frontrun by routing frontend traffic through private mempools such as Flashbots Protect. For layer 2 deployments, MEV is currently largely a nonissue.","Oracle Independent- Collar currently relies on Uniswap TWAP observations as opposed to offchain price providers. These Uniswap TWAP oracles are available on far more assets than Chainlink, etc. This could be made modular in the future."]}],[{"l":"Lifecycle"},{"l":"Settlement at Maturity","p":["Currently, maturities of expired positions are facilitated by a permitted \"keeper\" which is hosted in the \"Offchain Intent Platform\" (i.e. a server running a cron job on a periodic basis)","This is purely done to improve the user experience and is a target for decentralization / removal in future versions with incentives"]}],[{"l":"Risks and Limitations"},{"l":"Key Risks","p":["Hack Risk","DeFi protocols have been hacked before and there is a large incentive to steal user assets from the protocol. Collar has been designed in such a way that minimizes hack surface area to, on average, around ~ 25% of TVT (Total Volume Traded), since users take the majority out as a loan day one.","Note on mitigation: Collar works with top security firms in the space to ensure user funds are protected from hackers. Collar will also run a bug bounty program to disincentivize hacking and encourage bugs to be reported for a smaller, legal payoff.","Layer 2 Risks","These include sequencer downtime, MEV, or any other bespoke risk to any layer 2 Collar is deployed on.","Illiquidity Risk","Users, when repaying loans, must consider the liquidity of the market they are repaying into. If the Uni v3 pool is illiquid, slippage could eat up a large portion of repaid funds, leading to poor execution."]},{"l":"Key Limitations of Collar","p":["Users must be comfortable temporarily limiting upside in order to protect downside","This can be partially mitigated with rolls and even more so with \"auto-roll\", which remains under development","Savvy solvers to participate in the protocol actively","Where there is money to be made, solvers tend to participate.","Lack of AMM liquidity","This is rarely an issue, after all, if there's no spot market, why even try to create products that are more complex.","Potential barriers to understanding and entry","Collar can be a lot for the average user to understand, which is why we're committed to transparency and simplicity.","Declined pricing for rolls in highly volatile times","Solvers may not always provide roll pricing, which is a risk.","Lack of desire for solvers to quote the most volatile of tail assets","Solvers may not be willing to quote the latest dog, frog, or memecoin.","Market impact upon sale of assets into DEX","It's arguably better to have the market absorb this sale in good times rather than bad, however market impact is largely unavoidable, as it's inherently bearish to borrow against an asset."]}],[{"l":"Marketmaking"},{"l":"Solvers quote prices offchain and provide liquidity onchain","p":["Solvers are essentially offering a payout financially equivalent to a call spread to the borrower to replace exposure lost from the upfront sale of the asset. If the marketmaker successfully hedges their delta over the life of the trade and the realized volatility of the trade over its life comes in higher than the implied price they bought it for, the marketmaker should profit.","Link here explaining this \"gamma scalping\" mechanism.","By agreeing to hedge a Collar, solvers are expected to deposit sufficient USDC to ensure that the client will get fully paid out in the best case scenario (appreciation of the underlier to the ceiling).","Hedging this trade is inherently bearish because solvers make the most when the asset falls in value. As such, they naturally would want to go long the underlying asset in response to a completed trade (i.e. hedging your delta). There is also volatility exposure for a fixed period of time, at a specific strike, which is a bit harder to hedge.","Upon client execution, Collar immediately swaps the asset for USDC via a decentralized exchange such as Uniswap, pays out the loan to the user, then holds the remaining client collateral in escrow until maturity alongside the marketmaker's collateral.","Over the life of the trade, if the price of the underlying asset increases, the client will likely want to \"roll\" the trade higher. To do this, they can accept an extension offer from a marketmaker.","At maturity, any party (solvers, users, keepers, etc.) can mature a Collar vault by calling the \"mature\" function. Once this is called, funds are paid out to the marketmaker and user in line with the final price of the asset (as determined by Uniswap v3's TWAP) in line with whatever terms were agreed with upfront via the peer-to-pool execution mechanism.","Collar, unlike many other DeFi protocols, does not rely on unsustainable incentives to achieve user or marketmaker adoption and instead relies on solvers acting in their self-interest.","For now, marketmaking is permissionless onchain and access to the Offchain Intent Platform is whitelisted.
