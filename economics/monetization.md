Solvers price in a required fee for the protocol of 90 basis points (0.9%). This is in line with other protocols and platforms in the space.

- Opensea - 2.5% secondary - 10% primary drops
- Uniswap - 0.05% stables - 0.30% on majors - 1% on most volatile
- AAVE / Solend - 5% liquidation bonus, 50bps to AAVE for majors, up to 15% + 1.5% on most volatile
- Lido - 10% fees on staking rewards

Votre - 0.90% \* maturity (in years). E.g. a 6 month Votre would have a 45bp fee.

A critical difference between Votre and other protocols is that borrowers, protocol, and solvers all make more when crypto goes up, whereas liquidation revenue is higher when markets sell off.

Fees are paid onchain to the multi-sig controlled Votre treasury address.
