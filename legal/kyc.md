### Votre's Compliance with Financial Regulations

Votre is committed to adhering to local anti-money laundering regulations as part of our robust financial compliance program. These regulations require us to verify your identity before granting full access to our services. We achieve this through our know-your-customer (KYC) program powered by [Persona](https://withpersona.com/), which is one of the initial steps when you sign up for a new account.
