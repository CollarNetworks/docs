### Votre's Compliance with Financial Regulations

Votre is committed to adhering to local anti-money laundering regulations as part of our robust financial compliance program. These regulations require us to verify your identity before granting full access to our services. We achieve this through our know-your-customer (KYC) program powered by [Persona](https://withpersona.com/), which is one of the initial steps when you sign up for a new account.

### KYC Process

The KYC process is designed to ensure the authenticity of our users and to prevent fraudulent activities. It involves a series of steps to verify your identity and comply with regulatory requirements.

### KYC Verification Steps

- **Document Upload**: Upload a valid government-issued ID (e.g., passport, driver's license, or national ID card).
- **Selfie Verification**: Take a selfie to match against your ID document.
- **Address Verification**: Provide your current address to verify your residency.

### Troubleshooting

If you experience any issues during the KYC process, please contact our support team for assistance.
