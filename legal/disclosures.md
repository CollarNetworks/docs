An Aside on Gas Fees

The ethereum network incentivizes its validators to transmit money, value, and funds using the Ether token. We do not transmit any money or value or keep track of who owns what. We simply use these 3rd party rails to conduct lending and swaps business.

Collar does not collect or earn gas fees paid by users, these fees are earned by validators of the Ethereum network.

In the future, Collar plans to sponsor gas fees to make it easier for users to use the protocol.
