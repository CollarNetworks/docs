You represent and warrant that (a) you own Your Content or have the right to grant the rights and licenses in these Terms; and (b) Your Content and our use of Your Content, as licensed herein, does not and will not violate, misappropriate or infringe on any third party’s rights.</p>
</li>
<li><p>PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
7.1. You acknowledge that certain aspects of the Services may use, incorporate or link to certain open-source components and that your use of the Services is subject to, and you will comply with, any applicable open-source licenses that govern any such open-source components (collectively, the “Open-Source Licenses”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you may not (a) resell, lease, lend, share, distribute, or otherwise permit any third party to use the Services; (b) use the Services for time-sharing or service bureau purposes; or (c) otherwise use the Services in a manner that violates the Open-Source Licenses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>7.2. Excluding third-party software that the Services incorporates, as between you and Collar, Collar owns the Services, including all technology, content and other materials used, displayed or provided on the Site or in connection with the Services (including all intellectual property rights subsisting therein, whether or not subject to the Open-Source Licenses), and hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and use those portions of the Site and the Services that are proprietary to Collar and not available pursuant to the Open-Source Licenses.</p>
<p>7.3.

You may not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with the Site or the Services.</p>
<p>7.4. The Services are non-custodial. When you deposit Digital Assets into any smart contract available on the Interface, you are not transferring Digital Assets to Collar, and you retain control over those Digital Assets at all times. The private key associated with the Ethereum address from which you transfer Digital Assets is the only private key that can control the Digital Assets you transfer into the smart contracts available on the Interface.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><p>LINKS
The Services or third parties may provide, links to other World Wide Web or accessible sites, applications, or resources. You acknowledge and agree that Collar is not responsible for the availability of such external sites, applications or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites or resources.

We may, at our sole discretion, from time to time and with or without prior notice to you, modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof) with or without notice, for any reason whatsoever, including to only allow open Contracts to be closed. Upon termination of your access, your right to use the Services will immediately cease. We will not be liable for any losses suffered by you resulting from any modification, suspension or discontinuance of any Services or from any modification, suspension or termination, for any reason, of your access to all or any portion of the Services. The following sections of these Terms will survive any termination of your access to the Site or the Services, regardless of the reasons for its expiration or termination, in addition to any other provision which by law or by its nature should survive: Section 7 and Sections 9 through Section 17.</p>
</li>
<li><p>RISKS
10.1. By accessing or using the Services , you understand and agree to the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems and blockchain-based networks; Digital Assets, including the usage and intricacies of native Digital Assets, like ether (ETH); smart contract-based tokens, including fungible tokens and NFTs; and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. Collar does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed. In general, the software underlying blockchain networks, including the Ethereum blockchain, is open source, such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree (a) that Collar is not responsible for the operation of the blockchain-based software and networks underlying the Services, (b) that there exists no guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of that software and networks, and (c) that the underlying blockchain-based networks are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as “forks,” which may materially affect the Services. Blockchain networks use public and private key cryptography. You alone are responsible for securing your private key(s). We do not have access to your private key(s). Losing control of your private key(s) will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to Digital Assets on the Ethereum blockchain or other blockchain-based networks. Neither Collar nor any other person or entity will be able to retrieve or protect your Digital Assets. If your private key(s) are lost, then you will not be able to transfer your Digital Assets to any other blockchain address or wallet. If this occurs, then you will not be able to realize any value or utility from the Digital Assets that you may hold.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>10.2. You acknowledge and understand that the Services and your Digital Assets could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Collar to continue to make available our proprietary software and could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Services.</p>
<p>10.3. You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code cracking or other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to Digital Assets and the Services, and could result in the theft or loss of your Digital Assets. To the extent possible, the smart contracts available on the Interface will be updated to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks presented from technological advancements, but that intention does not guarantee or otherwise ensure full security of the Services.</p>
<p>10.4. You understand that the Ethereum blockchain remains under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Services in addition to uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the Ethereum blockchain is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain, which may result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Services.</p>
<p>10.5. You acknowledge that the Services are subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided relating to the Services. This warning and other warnings that Collar provides in these Terms are in no way evidence or represent an on-going duty to alert you to all of the potential risks of utilizing the Services.</p>
<p>10.6. Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information and data on the Site and during your use of the Services, the Site and other information available when using the Services may not always be entirely accurate, complete, or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you acknowledge and understand that you should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the Site or as part of the Services are your sole responsibility. No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the Site or otherwise when using the Services. Prices and pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on platforms providing similar services.</p>
<p>10.7. Any use or interaction with the Services requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science to appreciate the inherent risks, including those listed above. You represent and warrant that you possess relevant knowledge and skills. Any reference to a type of Digital Asset on the Site or otherwise during the use of the Services does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the Digital Asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset.</p>
<p>10.8. Use of the Services in particular for entering into Contracts may carry financial risk. Digital Assets, especially in connection with Contracts, are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection with the Services are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading Digital Assets, especially entering into Contracts, can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying Digital Assets, including Contracts. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with the Services or any Digital Asset. You accept all consequences of using the Services, including the risk that you may lose access to your Digital Assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no circumstances be liable to you for any loss or injury sustained by you or any third parties in connection with, your use of the Services for performing Digital Asset transactions, including entering into Contracts.</p>
<p>10.9. We must comply with Applicable Law, which may require us to, upon request by government agencies, take certain actions or provide information. You acknowledge and understand that Collar may in its sole discretion take any action it deems appropriate to cooperate with government agencies or comply with Applicable Law.</p>
<p>10.10. You understand that blockchains to which smart contracts are deployed may remain under development, which creates technological, trading, and other risks when using the Services. These risks include, among others, delays in trades, withdrawals, and deposits resulting from the servers of Collar or the operator of the blockchains being offline; an incorrect display of information on the Site in the case of server errors; or transactions using the Services being rolled back in the case of server errors. You acknowledge that these risks may have a material impact on your transactions using the Services, which may result in, among other things, failing to fulfill transactions at your desired price or at all.</p>
<p>10.11. You understand that you are responsible for all trades you place, including any erroneous orders that may be filled. We do not take any action to resolve erroneous trades that result from your errors.</p>
<p>10.12. You hereby assume the risks set forth in this Section 10 and Section 2, and acknowledge and agree that Collar will have no responsibility or liability for the risks set forth in this Section 10. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against Collar and our shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives, suppliers, and contractors (“Representatives”) related to any of the risks set forth in this Section 10 and Section 2.</p>

<p>12.2 You understand that Collar is not registered or licensed by any regulatory agency or authority. No such agency or authority has reviewed or approved the use of the Services.</p>
<p>12.3 To the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, the Services (and any of their content or functionality) provided by or on behalf of us are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, and we expressly disclaim, and you hereby waive, any representations, conditions or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, legal, statutory or otherwise, or arising from statute, otherwise in law, course of dealing, or usage of trade, and whether or not known or discoverable, including the implied or legal warranties and conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, quality or fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, availability, reliability, accuracy, quiet enjoyment and non-infringement of third party rights. Without limiting the foregoing, we do not represent or warrant that the Services (including any data relating thereto) will be uninterrupted, available at any particular time, or error-free. Further, we do not warrant that errors in the Services are correctable or will be correctable.</p>

<ol start="13">
<li>LIMITATION OF DAMAGES; EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED DAMAGES
13.1 Without limitation of any other provision of these Terms, you hereby agree that neither Collar nor any of its Representatives will have any responsibility or liability whatsoever for any loss or injury sustained by you or any third parties as a result of (i) any equipment or technology or other infrastructure delay, inaccessibility, or malfunctions; (ii)periodic maintenance procedures or repairs that Collar or any of our suppliers or contractors may undertake from time to time; (iii) causes beyond Collar’s control or that Collar could not reasonably foresee; (iv) disruptions and temporary or permanent unavailability of underlying blockchain infrastructure; or (v) unavailability of third-party service providers or external partners for any reason. Under no circumstances will Collar or its Representatives have any liability for any such loss or injury caused by any of the foregoing events, including but not limited to any obligation to cover or reimburse any damages or losses caused by such events. You expressly acknowledge that any risk of loss resulting from such events shall be borne by you, and you expressly assume any and all such risks.</li>
</ol>
<p>13.2 In no event will Collar, our suppliers and contractors, and Collar’s or our suppliers’ and contractors’ respective stockholders, members, directors, officers, managers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers and contractors (collectively, the “Risk Limited Parties”) be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive, consequential or similar damages or liabilities whatsoever (including damages for loss of fiat, assets, data, information, revenue, opportunities, use, goodwill, profits or other business or financial benefit) arising out of or in connection with the Services (and any of their respective content and functionality), any execution or settlement of a transaction, any performance or non-performance of the Services, your Digital Assets, Contracts or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of Collar, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability statute strict liability breach of warranties or under any other theory of liability and whether or not we have been advised of, knew of or should have known of the possibility of such damages and, notwithstanding any failure of the essential purpose of these Terms or any limited remedy hereunder, nor is Collar in any way responsible for the execution or settlement of transactions between users of the Services.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li><p>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Without limitation of any provision of these Terms, in the event that Collar or any related party is found liable under these Terms, the aggregate liability of Collar (together with our equity owners, members, directors, managers, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, or contractors), arising out of or in connection with your use of the Services (and any of their content and functionality), any performance or nonperformance of the Services, your Digital Assets, Contracts or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of Collar, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability or other theory of liability, will not exceed the amount of fees paid by you to Collar under these Terms, if any, in the two (2) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim for liability.</p>
</li>
<li><p>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT AGAINST Collar IN ANY COURT OR GOVERNING AUTHORITY. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED BELOW, THIS SECTION REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR DISAGREEMENT (EACH A “DISPUTE”) ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE THAT AROSE BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATES OF THESE TERMS, TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS SECTION EXTENDS TO DISPUTES THAT AROSE OR INVOLVE FACTS OCCURING BEFORE THE EXISTENCE OF THIS OR ANY PRIOR VERSIONS OF THE TERMS AS WELL AS DISPUTES THAT MAY ARISE AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THE TERMS.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You and Collar agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services is personal to you and Collar and that any Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding.</p>
<p>Nothing in this Section precludes you or Collar from bringing an individual action for damages in a small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court, or from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in court for infringement or other alleged misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).</p>
<p>Except as specified above, you and Collar waive your rights to a judge or jury trial or to have any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in court. Instead, for any Dispute that you have against Collar or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact Collar and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to Collar by email at <a href="mailto:operations@collarnetworks.com">operations@collarnetworks.com</a>. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Collar cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California, under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
<p>You and Collar agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 15 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
<p>The arbitrator, Collar, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including all information gathered, prepared, and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>
<p>You and Collar agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and all other JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Collar, Collar will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Collar agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>
<p>Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Collar will not have the right to assert the claim.</p>
<p>If any portion of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 15 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis under this Section 15; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 15 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, then that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 15 will be enforceable.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li><p>GOVERNING LAW
The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any Dispute related to these Terms or the Services, will be governed by and construed and enforced under the laws of the State of California, as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. For any other proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in any such courts.</p>

<p>17.8. These Terms contain the entire agreement between you and Collar, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties with respect to the Services.</p>
<p>17.9. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with us, these Terms will control unless such other agreement specifically identifies these Terms and declares that such other agreement supersedes these Terms.</p>
<p>17.10. You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, there is no third-party beneficiaries to the Agreement other than the Indemnified Parties.</p>

<li>APPLE-ENABLED SOFTWARE
With respect to the mobile application that is made available by Collar for your use in connection with an Apple-branded product (the “Apple-Enabled Software”), in addition to the other terms and conditions set forth in these Terms, the following terms and conditions apply:</li>
</ol>
<p>Collar and you acknowledge that these Terms are concluded only between Collar and you, and not with Apple Inc. or its affiliates (collectively, “Apple”), and that as between Collar and Apple, Collar, not Apple, is solely responsible for the Apple-Enabled Software and the content thereof.</p>
<p>You may not use the Apple-Enabled Software in any manner that is in violation of or inconsistent with the Usage Rules set forth for Apple-Enabled Software in, or otherwise be in conflict with, the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions (the “Usage Rules”).</p>
<p>Your license to use the Apple-Enabled Software is limited to a non-transferable license to use the Apple-Enabled Software on an iOS product that you own or control, as permitted by the Usage Rules.</p>
<p>Apple has no obligation whatsoever to provide any maintenance or support services with respect to the Apple-Enabled Software.</p>
<p>Apple is not responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law. In the event of any failure of the Apple-Enabled Software to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the Apple-Enabled Software, if any, to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Apple-Enabled Software, or any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty, which will be Collar’s sole responsibility, to the extent it cannot be disclaimed under applicable law.</p>
<p>Collar and you acknowledge that Collar, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the Apple-Enabled Software or your possession or use of that Apple-Enabled Software, including: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the Apple-Enabled Software fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (c) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation.</p>
<p>In the event of any third-party claim that the Apple-Enabled Software or your possession and use of that Apple-Enabled Software infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between Collar and Apple, Collar, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a United States government embargo, or that has been designated by the United States government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any United States government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>
<p>You must comply with applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the Apple-Enabled Software, including your wireless data service agreement.</p>
<p>Collar and you acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms with respect to the Apple-Enabled Software, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you with respect to the Apple-Enabled Software as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, complaints, or claims with respect to the Apple-Enabled Software, the foregoing should be directed to Collar in accordance with Section 17.2.</p>
