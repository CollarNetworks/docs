Opt out of marketing communications. You may opt out of marketing-related emails by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email. You may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails.

Online tracking opt-out. There are a number of ways to limit online tracking, which we have summarized below:

Blocking cookies in your browser. Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.

Using privacy plug-ins or browsers. You can block our Services from setting cookies by using a browser with privacy features, like Brave, or installing browser plugins like Privacy Badger, DuckDuckGo, Ghostery or uBlock Origin, and configuring them to block third party cookies/trackers.

Google analytics. We use Google Analytics to collect and summarize information about how individuals engage with the Services. For more information on Google Analytics, click here. For more information about Google’s privacy practices, click here. You can opt out of Google Analytics by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

Note that because these opt-out mechanisms are specific to the device or browser on which they are exercised, you will need to opt out on every browser and device that you use.

Do Not Track. Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” or similar signals. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

Personal information rights requests. We offer you choices that affect how we handle the personal information that we control. These privacy rights may not apply to the information we collect, use or disclose about individuals who apply for or obtain a loan from Collar Networks. This is because this information is subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and implementing regulations, or the California Financial Information Privacy Act (“CalFIPA”). The GLBA and/or CalFIPA may govern the information of users who initiated the process of applying for our financial products or services.

If you have not applied for or obtained a loan from Collar Networks, you may request the following in relation to your personal information:

Information about how we collect and use your personal information. We have made this information available to you without having to request it by including it in this Privacy Policy.

Access and portability. You may request a copy of the personal information that we have collected about you. Where applicable, we will provide the information in a portable, machine-readable, and readily usable format.

Correction of personal information that is inaccurate or out of date.

Deletion of personal information that we no longer need to provide the Services or for other lawful purposes.

We do not sell your personal information.

You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.

Please note that the law of your state may limit these rights by, for example, prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive information in response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a deletion request. If we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to you.

To make a request, you may visit https://pukzi11x7je.typeform.com/to/mdLqfLtS to submit a request

Identity verification. We will need to confirm your identity to process your requests to exercise your data subject rights. We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.

Authorized agents. California residents can empower an “authorized agent” to submit requests on their behalf. We will require the authorized agent to have a written authorization confirming that authority.

5. Data Security

We use encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments to safeguard your Non-Public Personal Information (NPI) from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, following industry-standard security measures and GLBA’s Safeguards Rule.

6. GLBA Compliance

We collect Non-Public Personal Information (NPI) under GLBA, which may include your first name, last name, email address, and blockchain wallet address.
