#### Unfortunately, Collar is not yet available in the U.S.

While we are fans of America and the values it was founded on, which we believe crypto represents, due to burdensome registration requirements for parties trading and creating derivatives on commodities, we've deferred offering Collar to U.S. investors until a later date.

Please do not utilize Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology to access the smart contracts or frontend webpages of Collar. We go out of our way to block this type of traffic, as well as blocking suspicious wallet addresses.

Given our team's TradFi experience, we take the Securities and Commodities Regulations in the United States very seriously.

Please regard any mention of a future hypothetical token as purely speculative and meant to be taken as a promise of an investment opportunity.

Our team aspires to achieve full decentralization in the near future and we are building out infrastructure to achieve that.

At Collar, we deploy open-source code to open networks for the betterment of the public. At this time, we do not offer investment advice nor custody of funds.

We do not have any way to access vaults created by smart contracts we've deployed, Collar is purely public financial infrastructure.
